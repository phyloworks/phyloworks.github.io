			  <div class="well">
				<p>Rates of Molecular Evolution — Accurate estimates of species divergence times are vital 
				to answering questions about historical biogeography, estimating diversification rates, and 
				identifying the causes of variation in rates of molecular evolution. However, obtaining reliable 
				divergence time estimates is confounded by the fact that the rate of evolution and time are intrinsically 
				linked. I am currently working on new models for estimating branch lengths in units proportional to time 
				without assuming a strict molecular clock. Our understanding of how substitution rates change over time 
				is still underdeveloped. My research in this field is aimed at identifying models that accommodate rate 
				change resulting from different processes. Such flexible models can provide more accurate estimates of 
				species divergence times. 
				I developed a model for estimating lineage-specific substitution rates that employs a Dirichlet 
				process prior (DPP) for modeling mixtures of data. Under this model, branches of a phylogenetic tree are 
				clustered into specific rate classes and the number of different rate classes and their associated rates 
				are treated as random variables. Thus, a strict molecular clock and a model where each lineage evolves 
				independently at a different rate are special cases of this model. Analyses of simulated data show that 
				divergence times and branch rates are more accurate under the DPP when compared with alternative models 
				for substitution rate variation. Furthermore, Bayesian inference under this model can identify how 
				phylogenetic lineages are partitioned according to substitution rate, information unavailable under 
				alternative priors. (See <a href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/3/939">Heath et al., MBE 2012</a>)
				</p>
				<p>
				Rates of Morphological Evolution — The DPP model for substitution-rate variation extends naturally 
				to characterize how rates of morphological change vary among lineages. This work is in collaboration with PhD students 
				Mike May (UC–Davis) and Michael Landis (UC–Berkeley), as well as Brian Moore (UC-Davis). 
				We are developing a hierarchical Bayesian method 
				to uncover patterns of phenotypic evolution. Under this model, we assume that the rate of continuous 
				trait evolution (assuming Brownian motion) varies across the tree according to a Dirichlet process. 
				We are implementing this novel method in a program that will allow for joint estimation of phenotypic 
				rates and divergence times, thus accommodating uncertainty in branch times and other phylogenetic 
				parameters. This integrative approach will allow us to evaluate correlated changes in rates of molecular 
				and morphological evolution.

                </h3>
			  <div class="well">
				<p>Historical observations in the form of fossil occurrence times or other geological data are 
				fundamental components necessary for inferring the absolute timing of speciation events. The 
				common approach to time calibration taken by most neontologists is to assign minimum age estimates, 
				based on fossil specimens, to nodes within their group of interest. However, we can rarely assign 
				fossils to nodes of a tree without error, and much of the information associated with fossil taxa is 
				lost when we try to represent the fossil record as a single time estimate applied to a single internal node.
				</p>
				<h4>The Fossilized Birth-Death Process</h4>
				<p>
				In collaboration with Tanja Stadler (ETH Zürich) and John Huelsenbeck (UC–Berkeley), I 
				developed a unified extant and extinct- species diversification model that eliminates the 
				need for the ad hoc prior densities that are common practice in Bayesian phylogenetics. The 
				‘fossilized birth-death’ (FBD) process is a model for calibrating divergence-time estimates 
				in a Bayesian framework and explicitly acknowledges that extant species and fossils are representatives 
				of the same macroevolutionary process. Under this model, we can estimate internal node ages conditional 
				on a tree of extant taxa and set of fossil occurrence times. We developed novel reversible-jump MCMC 
				methods to marginalize over realizations of this process and implemented them in a recent version of DPPDiv. 
				This model improves upon standard approaches for calibrating phylogenies with fossil data by allowing for 
				inclusion of all available fossils and providing coherent measures of statistical uncertainty. (See <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/29/E2957.abstract">Heath et al., PNAS 2014</a>)
				</p>
				<h4>Fossil Phylogenetics with Trilobites as a Model System</h4>
				<p>
				For some taxonomic groups, the fossil record provides a wealth of information about the evolution of 
				morphological characters and lineage diversification. Because of this, the development of methods for 
				fully integrating information from fossil specimens into phylogenetic analyses is a critical area of 
				research. Toward this end, I am collaborating with Drs. Mark Holder and Bruce Lieberman (U. Kansas) 
				to develop improved methods for likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis of morphological data with an 
				emphasis on fossil taxa. As part of this project, I will integrate complex models of morphological 
				evolution and stratigraphic information into Bayesian methods for phylogenetic inference. 
				This work will build on the FBD model and estimate the explicit phylogenetic relationships of fossil 
				organisms. Furthermore, we will extend the diversification models to account for our current 
				understanding of the rock record and stratigraphy. We will harness the rich fossil record of the 
				Trilobita, specifically the well-studied groups Olenellina and Cheiruridae, to evaluate and test 
				new phylogenetic methods. Ultimately, this work will expand our understanding of the patterns of 
				diversification and morphological evolution in this group. Furthermore, our methods are naturally 
				applicable to data sets combining both modern and fossil species, thus contributing to current 
				research in molecular phylogenetics and macroevolution. This project is funded by NSF grant 
				<a href="http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/fossil/">DEB-1256993</a>.

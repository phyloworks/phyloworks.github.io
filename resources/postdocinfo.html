				I am interested in collaborating with postdocs with any research background––including those from 
				biology, computer science, or statistics. Moreover, I am happy to discuss research projects 
				spanning the spectrum between purely theoretical/computational work to entirely empirical.

        <p>
        As a postdoctoral researcher, you should take this time to develop your own, independent research program.
        Consider the skills you wish to develop during this time and how the training will help you attain
        a permanent position in whatever sector you aspire to (e.g., tenure track, government, industry, teaching, etc.). 
        Additionally, think about your unique skills and how your contributions will be "value added" to my lab
        and EEOB. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Overall, I am looking for postdocs who will actively participate in the academic community. I will treat you 
		like an independent colleague and work to provide you with the training and opportunities you need to further your
		career. I was very fortunate during my time as a postdoc to be treated this way and I fully intend to pay it forward.
		</p>
		<h3>For those seeking to apply for their own, independent fellowships...</h3>
		<p>
		I am excited to work with anyone interested in phylogenetics and evolutionary biology. Otherwise, there
		are no limits to the types of postdoctoral projects I would support in my research group. For empiricists, there is no requirement
		for you to write software or develop statistical models and if you pursue research in my lab, we can think of lots of
		cool ways to combine our skills. 
		</p>
		If you have a computational biology background, there will be several opportunities for you to become involved in my
		ongoing software projects (though absolutely not required). In particular, I am on the development team of the program 
		<a href="https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes">RevBayes</a> and we are always happy to take on new developers and collaborators.

			<h4><p style="color:#460096"><b>Project Summary</b></p></h4>
			<p>
			Figs and their fig wasp pollinators and parasites have co-evolved for ~90 million years to become both highly diverse (>750 species of figs) and ecologically important “keystone” components of tropical forest ecosystems. Figs and wasps have long been assumed to represent a case of strict co-speciation, with highly specific pollinator and parasitic (non-pollinator) wasps identifying appropriate hosts via distinctive volatile chemical signals. More recent studies suggest a more complex scenario, however, involving an evolutionary history punctuated by host-shifts by individual wasp species. Although the wasp associations with fig hosts have been widely studied, the genetic consequences for the host figs of host-shifting pollinators and the mechanisms underlying host recognition remain poorly understood. 
			</p>
			<p>
			This project will fill these gaps by producing robust, detailed, many-gene phylogenies for 14 strangling fig (<i>Ficus</i>) species and their associated pollinating (<i>Pegoscapus</i>) and non-pollinating (<i>Idarnes</i>) fig wasps (~60 species) from the vicinity of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Using transcriptome sequences, we will target ~300 genes from each of three species per lineage for capture and subsequent Illumina sequencing. Phylogenies will be inferred using Bayesian methods and will enable robust testing of phylogenetic congruence between figs and fig wasps. Further, they will guide population-level genotype by sequencing to test a priori predictions of potential cases of hybridization in the figs and host shifting and race formation in both pollinator and non-pollinator wasps. Combined with quantification of wasp-attracting fig volatiles and fruit-surface chemicals, this work will detect and resolve the genomic consequences of host introgression due to host-shifting pollinator wasps, and link them to the chemical basis of host-recognition.
			</p>
			<p>
			This research will significantly clarify both the patterns and processes underlying the evolutionary ecology of fig and fig wasp interactions. Our standardized, genomic approach is essential for: 1) obtaining robust fig and fig wasp species trees, 2) delimiting fig species and discriminating cases of introgressive gene flow from shared ancestral polymorphism, and 3) linking introgression of figs and their chemical phenotypes to cases of pollinator host shifting. Our community-level approach is also essential to obtain the across-species replication necessary for robust statistical inference of diversification pattern and process across interacting fig and wasp taxa.
